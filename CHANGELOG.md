**Upgrade notes:** this version drops support for starting the celery-related
daemons (worker and scheduler) using the "./manage.py | squad-admin" command
line interface. To start those daemons, you should now use the standard celery
command line interface, i.e.

* `celery -A squad worker` for the worker, and
* `celery -A squad beat` for the scheduler.


**Changes:**

* api:
  * Added a REST API for accessing most of the data in SQUAD. This API is only
    adequate for read-only access for now.
  * The API is self-describing and features a API browser when accessed with a
    web browser. This API browser is linked from the navigation bar at the top.
* frontend:
  * make login link redirect to original page
* settings:
  * respect proxy headers when generating absolute URLs
* upgrade to celery v4
  * Drop support for SQL-backed periodic task scheduling

**IMPORTANT:** starting from this version, the LAVA backend for CI jobs
requires that PyYAML has been compiled with support for libyaml. So if you are
upgrading from a previous version and are using the LAVA integration, make sure
that is the case.

  * `python3 -c 'import yaml; print(yaml.__with_libyaml__)'` must print `True`
  * if not, make sure you have the development files for libyaml installed
    (e.g. `libyaml-dev`) _before_ (re)installing PyYAML.
    * To reinstall PyYAML:
      `pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir PyYAML`

      data has been commited to the database by the process requesting the
      notification.
  * Build data:
    * don't count tests that have been retried twice. e.g. if a test job is
      resubmitted, the test results produced will override any corresponding
      test results from previous test jobs.

    reduction of ~95% in the response time.
  * avoid producing exceptions when users try to access an unexisting group
    (not just returns an 404 error quietly).

    that already has details displayed, from the full list of builds).
  * hide resubmit button from unprivileged users (who should't be allowed to
    resubmit in the first place).
* ci/lava:
  * automatically resubmit jobs that failed due to infrastructure problems that
    we already know about.
