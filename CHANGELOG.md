# 1.75.1

This 1.75.1 release fixes 2 small bugs from past release.

First one is to avoid getting build_name from oe builds and the second bug fix is related
to loading projects with builds without status objects associated.

The latter would only happen on SQUAD instances older than 2018.

# 1.75

This 1.75 release fixes an important bug that has been around unnoticed for quite some time.

The bug is basically a race condition when a build is marked as finished too early, before
all testjobs results are actually done processing. The fix should address that issue.

The release also allows listing projects in group's home page by active in last N days. Within
project settings one can determine N.

There has been added support for accepting OE builds from Tuxsuite and support for squad-client
will come soon.

Complete list of changes going in:

* api/rest.py: re-add suite to failures with confidence endpoint
* ci/backend/tuxsuite.py: support oe builds
* ci/models.py: bring pending function to TestJob
* settings.py: support newer versions of django-allauth
* squad/core/models.py: Change important metadata to support custom order
* squad/frontend/views.py,squad/core/models.py: move sorting of metadata
* squad/frontend/views.py: Add support for filtering project list by age

# 1.74

This 1.74 release patches a couple of pages improving overall performance.

It improves loading times of build tests page, test history and build comparison by tests.

The release also removes "Test failures" page, given that there's already and API endpoint
for it and it is cumbersome to maintain an UI for it as well. Finaly, this release removes
the transitions table from build comparison page, which allowed users to query changes by
specific transitions. This is too expensive to compute in larger SQUAD instances.

Complete list of changes going in:

* api/rest.py:
  * fix failures with confidence pagination
  * re-add test id and test run on failures_with_confidence endpoint
  * support looking release builds only
* backend/tuxsuite.py:
  * avoid making extra requests when retrieving build_name
  * support tuxsuite sanity tests
* core/failures.py: use past N builds instead past N tests
* core/history.py: improve history performance
* frontend/comparison.py: refactor comparison to show off regressions and fixes only
* frontend/tests.py:
  * allow filtering tests by environment and suite
  * catch non-existant tests
  * reduce query size
* remove frontend/failures.py: there's an API endpoint for it

# 1.73

This release fixes a variety of bugs:

* flake8: fix misc new flake8 complaints
* frontend/templatetags: support newer versions of allauth package
* frontend/views.py: handle requests provinding invalid testrun id
* templates/notification/diff.txt.jinja2: fix typo when referencing environments from known issues

in the test model last year. It's important that if you are running
a older squad instance that after this release you run the following
command:

`./manage populate_metric_build_and_environment`

This will ensure that all new metrics will have the correct data migrated.

# 1.38

This 1.38 release fixes two major bugs in SQUAD when communicating
with LAVA backends:

     SQUAD should handle the outage an give up trying to
     fetch such jobs.
  2. When LAVA jobs fail due to "metadata is too large",
     the results api won't return a valid metadata field,
     thus causing SQUAD to break on that too

* core: commands, rewrite command to fix tradefed

# 1.28

This 1.28 release starts using storage to provide
TestRun and Attachment files, deprecating the use
of the same fields in the DB. Future releases will
completely remove such fields and will help control
database growth on installations with lots of data.

The release also clears TestJob fetch failures after
a successful fetch. It also fixes a bug in the bell
icon in the project page that signals whether or not
a user is subscribed to that project.

Complete list of changes going in:

* api:
  * rest: hide deprecated TestRun file fields
  * rest: make build, project and suitemetadata listings faster
* ci:
  * add started_at and ended_at fields to TestJob
  * models: clear TestJob.falure on successful
* core:
  * models: add save_files to TestRun
  * models: delete files as TestRun and Attachment are deleted
  * models: deprecate TestRun and Attachment storage database fields
* frontend: notification bug

# 1.27.1

This is a quick release to hide storage fields

Complete list of changes going in:

* api: rest: hide storage fields

# 1.27

This 1.27 release starts using external storage for test
run files as a step prior to remove them from DB. Next releases
will come accordingly.

The release also works around a bug with LAVA REST responses
that don't always include the unit of a metric.

Lastly, this release adds a new model called `PluginScratch`, to be
used by plugins whenever extra database storage is required. Plugins
should clean up their data after work is finished.

# 1.26

This 1.26 marks a big change in SQUAD: it *completely removes
the name from Test models*. This field/column is the responsible
for half the size of DB and it might become an issue in setups 
with hundreds of millions of tests.

This release also starts adapting SQUAD to use storage for TestRun
files (tests, metrics and logs) and Attachment. The next release
should start using these new fields and further releases will swap
to use storage fields only, thus saving lots of space in DB.

The release also fixes a timeout when viewing a build page, and a
timeout when acessing api for testrun/suite tests.

Lastly, this release makes Postgres an optional dependency for
SQUAD, which now should be installed as `pip install squad[postgres]`
if that RDBS is required, otherwise Sqlite will be used instead.

# 1.10.1

This is a bug fix release:

In case the job is still in the queue or is in progress, fetch() raises
TemporaryFetchIssue from within block that catches FetchIssue. Since
TemporaryFetchIssue derives from FetchIssue, the exception is
immediately consumed and fetch_attempts counter is increased. This leads
to maxing out fetch_counter for jobs that stay in the queue for a long
time. This patch removes the exception and instead returns from the
fetch() function without an error. This doesn't result in increasing
fetch_attempt counter.

# 1.2

This 1.2 release fixes a couple of performance issues when fetching testjobs
from backends and when using the REST api, among other small fixes.

It stops ignoring duplicated tests for same environments and test suites
when calculating build summary (e.g. number of passing and failing tests).
Instead, use partial summaries already calculated for test runs.

We tweaked the backend code that fetches tests before calculating
regressions and fixes. If a build had a significant high number of test runs
it would make comparison much slower. So we avoid querying all test runs at
once when running `TestComparison`.

There were changes in the backend code of the REST api that reduced the number
of trips to db, making some endpoints load faster.

Complete changelog below:

* core:
  * comparison: remove the use of iterator over tests
  * comparison: filter tests by chunks of testruns

# 1.0

This 1.0 release marks the availability of a feature set that we envisioned
back when squad was started. We still have a lot to improve, though, so we will
continue to work on new features and improvements.

This release also brings compatibility with Django 2, which we now use by
default. However, using with Django 1 is still supported. We recommend Python
3.6 or newer.

Since we are bumping the major version number, we are also making two
backwards-incompatible changes that you need to be aware of:

* Test results from incomplete jobs are now completely ignored.
* The LAVA CI backend used to map the success of the "auto-login-action" from a
  lava job to a test called "boot". This is now ignored by default. If you rely
  on this, you can re-enable this behavior by setting `CI_LAVA_HANDLE_BOOT` in
  your project settings (only available in the Django admin interface for the
  moment). See the documentation for details.

**Upgrade notes:** this version drops support for starting the celery-related
daemons (worker and scheduler) using the "./manage.py | squad-admin" command
line interface. To start those daemons, you should now use the standard celery
command line interface, i.e.

* `celery -A squad worker` for the worker, and
* `celery -A squad beat` for the scheduler.


**Changes:**

* api:
  * Added a REST API for accessing most of the data in SQUAD. This API is only
    adequate for read-only access for now.
  * The API is self-describing and features a API browser when accessed with a
    web browser. This API browser is linked from the navigation bar at the top.
* frontend:
  * make login link redirect to original page
* settings:
  * respect proxy headers when generating absolute URLs

**IMPORTANT:** starting from this version, the LAVA backend for CI jobs
requires that PyYAML has been compiled with support for libyaml. So if you are
upgrading from a previous version and are using the LAVA integration, make sure
that is the case.

  * `python3 -c 'import yaml; print(yaml.__with_libyaml__)'` must print `True`
  * if not, make sure you have the development files for libyaml installed
    (e.g. `libyaml-dev`) _before_ (re)installing PyYAML.

      `pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir PyYAML`

* setup.py: correctly exclude code from test/ from being installed
* submit-test-data: also generate skips

# 0.24

* core
  * provide test suites executed by environment
* README updates

# 0.23

* core/notification:
  * add support for having a custom subject as part of an email notification
    template.

# 0.22

* ci
  * handle fetching failures with less noise, and in a way that is independent
    of the test job backend. This reverts the LAVA-specific handling added in
    0.21.
* ci/lava
  * add support for using boot information from LAVA as an articial boot test
    and as a boot time metric.

# 0.21

* frontend:
  * Add missing red bar in group main page for test failures
* core:
  * add support for per-project custom email templates
  * comparison: use environment name is available
* Add script to run a development environment on docker
* ci/lava
  * log and notify by email any errors when fetching test jobs

# 0.20.3

* core:
  * add management command to force sending an email report.
    * This can be used for example to help local testing
* ci/lava:
  * filter events down do the ones we can (and want to) handle
* frontend:
  * fix crash when viewing projects with no data

# 0.20.2

* frontend:
  * fix javascript error

# 0.20.1

* core:
  * fix update of ProjectStatus objects

# 0.20

* core:
  * admin:
    * move "re-send notification" action to ProjectStatus
    * expose Build data
    * sort ProjectStatus by build date
  * Test results:
    * use just "skip" instead of "skip/unknown"
  * ProjectStatus: determine `previous` (baseline for comparison in
    notification) dinamically, by getting the previous build that has complete
    data.
  * Project: avoid duplicated projects in listing
  * notification: list explicitly number of skipped tests
* frontend: improve wording on project home page
* ci/listen: spawn listener processes without fork()

# 0.19

* core:
  * notifications:
    * retry if ProjectStatus id does not exist (yet). Handles race condition
      when worker process tries to send a notification before the corresponding
      data has been commited to the database by the process requesting the
      notification.
  * Build data:
    * don't count tests that have been retried twice. e.g. if a test job is
      resubmitted, the test results produced will override any corresponding
      test results from previous test jobs.
* frontend:
  * optimize database queries used to compose build page. Data tested shows a
    reduction of ~95% in the response time.
  * avoid producing exceptions when users try to access an unexisting group
    (not just returns an 404 error quietly).
  * show all builds in the project front page (i.e. don't omit the last build,
    that already has details displayed, from the full list of builds).
  * hide resubmit button from unprivileged users (who should't be allowed to
    resubmit in the first place).
* ci/lava:
  * automatically resubmit jobs that failed due to infrastructure problems that
    we already know about.

# 0.18.1

* core/admin:
  * display "moderate notifications" in project listing
  * filter ProjectStatus by project
  * add several filters for the project listing
* settings: set `SERVER_EMAIL`

# 0.18

* ci:
  * mark proper TestRun status on awkward LAVA failure
* frontend:
  * display squad version in the base template
  * several improvements to the UI to make browsing data more effective
* core:
  * notitifications are now sent immeditately after there is enough data for
    each build, instead of on pre-scheduled times.
  * notifications can now be moderated by admins before being sent out to
    users.

# 0.17

* core:
  * update "last updated" data every time new results arrive for a given build
  * notification: clearly identify tests that never passed as such
* ci:
  * lava: report incomplete TestRun when TestJob is canceled
* frontend:
  * fix group page to use correct status data (pass/fail counts, metric summary)

    alternative representation together with plain text content
* ci:
  * add job\_url to TestRun metadata if present
* ci/lava
  * filter LAVA logs to include only the serial console output
* infrastructure
  * settings: enable exception notifications by email
* frontend:
  * fix resubmit JS code
  * serve TestRun logs directly (i.e. allow viewing them in browser instead of
    forcing a download)
